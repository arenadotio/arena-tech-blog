    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At Arena, defining our culture is as important as the quality of the software we
deliver. One emanates from the other. In this blog post I share some of our
cultural values, using stories of real-life situations to illustrate how we
interact with each other on a daily basis: how we go about decision-making, how
we prioritize our work, and what we do when things slip through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A year ago I could never have imagined my last night in Havana. I found
myself at the hip Fábrica de Arte Cubano, sitting with a glass of Ron
Santiago on the rocks, listening to &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bartoszmilewski.com/&quot;&gt;Bartosz Milewski&lt;/a&gt; explain how to achieve determinism in a
concurrent system using a data structure called lattice variables (or
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dFO5Ir0xqY&quot;&gt;LVars&lt;/a&gt;).  Previously, I
was unhappily programming in Java doing Android Development for a large
tech company. After leaving, I found my current position with a small
company, Arena, that decided to write most of their software in
OCaml. At my company I was introduced &lt;a class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot; href=&quot;#id3&quot; id=&quot;id1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; to functional programming
concepts and the local FP community here in New York City. When my
co-worker, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://rgrinberg.com/&quot;&gt;Rudi&lt;/a&gt;, discovered that there would
be an FP conference, Monad Libre, in Cuba, a country still off limits to
American tourists, I knew I had to go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was a collaboration between Michelle Micallef and Trevor
Smith. Trevor is the VP of engineering at Arena. Michelle is an
engineer at Arena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting a company off the ground is an exercise in risk management. When
I was hired to build out engineering here at Arena, I was tasked to form
an engineering team and choose our founding technologies. These
decisions had to be made to maximize stability, while allowing us to
innovate quickly. An important choice was what language our engineers
would use. There are many ways a software engineer’s day is impacted by
the language &lt;a class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot; href=&quot;#id2&quot; id=&quot;id1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. I approached these decisions with a risk management
mindset. The idea is simple and commonplace: you weigh the risks of a
choice compared with the gain to those involved. This pragmatic strategy
was reinforced by a friend who advised me during this time to “go risky
on libraries, conservative on infrastructure.” This is what we did.&lt;/p&gt;
