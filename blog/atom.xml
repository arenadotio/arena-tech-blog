    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Getting a company off the ground is an exercise in risk management. When
I was hired to build out engineering here at Arena, I was tasked to form
an engineering team and choose our founding technologies. These
decisions had to be made to maximize stability, while allowing us to
innovate quickly. An important choice was what language our engineers
would use. There are many ways a software engineer’s day is impacted by
the language &lt;a class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot; href=&quot;#id2&quot; id=&quot;id1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. I approached these decisions with a risk management
mindset. The idea is simple and commonplace: you weigh the risks of a
choice compared with the gain to those involved. This pragmatic strategy
was reinforced by a friend who advised me during this time to “go risky
on libraries, conservative on infrastructure.” This is what we did.&lt;/p&gt;
