<h2>By Brandon Williams<a class="headerlink" href="#by-brandon-williams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Like most companies in predictive analytics, Arena has two groups of experts
with differing desires and skill sets: our data scientists constantly design,
test, and refine our algorithms that <a class="reference external" href="https://www.arena.io/solution.html">make predictions to improve health care
operations</a> our engineers build efficient,
scalable infrastructure to productionalize these algorithms, allowing us to
score new input data in real-time. Because of these different goals, there is
often a disconnect between model training and scoring. In the past, when it came
time to move a new algorithm to production, engineers had to manually
reimplement it in another system. Reimplementing anything in software is painful
&#8211; it comes with more bugs, more iteration, new library requirements, and
(because multiple teams are involved) more communication. Any tweaks from the
data science team would require additional work by engineering. This situation
was becoming a hindrance to our productivity, and we knew there had to be a
better way.</p>
<p>The solution we found was the <a class="reference external" href="http://dmg.org/pfa/">Portable Format for Analytics
(PFA)</a>. Arena has been using PFA as the interface between
model training and scoring in our products. One can think of it as a
language-independent data format to define modeling workflows, or, JSON for
models. The technology is new enough that we couldn’t find others writing about
the implementation process or their day-to-day experience working with it. As
such, I thought it would be useful to share our experience adopting and working
with PFA. So far, it has solved all of our use cases, and we have been happy
working with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pfa-is-an-easier-to-use-customizable-evolution-of-pmml">
<h2>PFA is an easier-to-use, customizable evolution of PMML<a class="headerlink" href="#pfa-is-an-easier-to-use-customizable-evolution-of-pmml" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The data scientists primarily write algorithms in Python or R. Until last year,
if we wanted the resulting models to be used for scoring, they would have to be
reimplemented by engineering in the language of our scoring system. Whenever we
wanted to tweak the model, the code would have to be modified in two different
places. This process was laborious and open to human error, subtle bugs, and
implementation differences.</p>
<p>We made it a priority to find a better solution that would</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>allow data scientists to investigate, train, test, and deploy different types
of models,</li>
<li>have the ability to run different models for different subsets of users,</li>
<li>remove the need for engineers having to manually implement models,</li>
<li>allow data scientists to view all properties of historically deployed models,
and</li>
<li>have easy &#8220;roll back&#8221; functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Early on, we considered letting data scientists deploy arbitrary Python or R
code. However, managing Python/R library dependencies in multiple environments
and embedding Python/R models into production applications is painful. (In fact,
there are <a class="reference external" href="https://www.yhat.com/products/scienceops">many</a>
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dominodatalab.com/">services</a> that offer to do this for you.)</p>
<p>The Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) seemed like a promising tool for
exchanging model descriptions between different environments, but it did not
meet all our needs since customizing and extending models with it is a
<a class="reference external" href="http://openscoring.io/blog/2015/05/15/jpmml_model_api_vendor_extensions/">slow</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://kdd13pmml.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/guazzelli_et_al.pdf">arduous</a>
process.</p>
<p>When we came across PFA, we were excited by the potential of the solution. In
many ways, PFA is a nice evolution of PMML: it is easier to use, it supports
custom modeling logic, it’s composable, and the user doesn’t have to write JSON.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="implementation">
<h2>Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The team for this project consisted of me (a data scientist) and two engineers.</p>
<p>First, we did a proof of concept to demonstrate that PFA would meet our
requirements. We took one of our existing production models and reimplemented it
in PFA, feeding the same inputs to both versions of the model. The resulting
scores were identical, and the process took less than two days.</p>
<p>Next, we built a new scoring system &#8211; we implemented all of our models in PFA
and wrote the necessary infrastructure in OCaml. Tools like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/opendatagroup/hadrian/wiki/PrettyPFA-Reference">PrettyPFA</a> made
writing PFA simple.</p>
<p>We shadow deployed this system alongside our existing scoring engine and
monitored the scores returned by each. After a few months of matching scores, we
flipped the switch to start using the new scoring system in production.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="concerns">
<h2>Concerns<a class="headerlink" href="#concerns" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We knew that PFA was not going to be an off-the-shelf solution. PFA provides a
standard format and a way to evaluate algorithms defined in that format, but we
had to build the infrastructure for managing the deployment of models and
scoring new data in production. Although the implementation was generally
smooth, we ran into a few problems while building this system.</p>
<div class="section" id="bugs">
<h3>Bugs<a class="headerlink" href="#bugs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Because PFA is a relatively new technology, it still has a few bugs. One of the
main benefits of PFA is that it is supposed to produce the same result from the
same input and model definition, even when they are evaluated in different
languages. But in one of our models, because of a slight difference between
PFA’s static typing for the Python (<a class="reference external" href="http://opendatagroup.github.io/hadrian/titus-0.8.3/titus.genpy.PFAEngine">Titus</a>)
and JVM (<a class="reference external" href="http://opendatagroup.github.io/hadrian/hadrian-0.8.3/index.html#com.opendatagroup.hadrian.jvmcompiler.PFAEngine">Hadrian</a>)
implementations, Titus was returning a float while Hadrian was returning an
integer. For this bug, we submitted an issue on Github and one of the senior
maintainers promptly fixed it. Since then, we have run into two additional bugs
and have started maintaining our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/arenadotio/hadrian/tree/daily">own fork</a> of Hadrian while we wait
for our upstream pull requests to be accepted. These types of bugs are expected
when using any new software; overall, the experience was better than we had
hoped, with quick turnarounds on diagnosing and fixing issues when they arose.</p>

<div class="section" id="benefits">
<h2>Benefits<a class="headerlink" href="#benefits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="simpler-faster-and-more-effective-workflow-from-experimentation-to-production">
<h3>Simpler, faster, and more effective workflow from experimentation to production<a class="headerlink" href="#simpler-faster-and-more-effective-workflow-from-experimentation-to-production" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Prior to implementing PFA, we struggled to keep up with the innovations of our
data science team in production. In large part, this was due to the clunkiness
of our old scoring system. Since implementing PFA, we have been able to design a
few new algorithms and easily deploy them to production. This allows the data
science team to have confidence that any experiments we run will not go to waste
&#8211; if a new model shows good results, we implement it in PFA. The benefits of
this new workflow cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we are currently developing new products to predict additional
client-specific outcomes. Our use of PFA has halved the time that this project
has taken. This means that not only are these products easier for our technical
teams to implement, but also that our clients save money.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="close-cross-team-collaboration-and-personal-development">
<h3>Close cross-team collaboration and personal development<a class="headerlink" href="#close-cross-team-collaboration-and-personal-development" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A great side effect of this project is that now both the engineering and data
science teams are intimately familiar with our scoring engine. Previously, we
each had limited and siloed understandings of the system; now, data scientists
have the agency to tweak our production models and deploy new ones without
engineering support. Additionally, this project was a good excuse for me to
learn OCaml, which has made me a better engineer. Finding opportunities for data
scientists and engineers to develop overlapping skills is always worthwhile and
facilitates better communication and better products.</p>
